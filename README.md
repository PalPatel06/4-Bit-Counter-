# 4-Bit-Counter-
This project implements a simple 4-bit binary counter using an Arduino board and 4 LEDs. Each LED represents one bit of the binary count, incrementing from 0000 (0) to 1111 (15) in a loop.
ğŸš€ Features
Counts from 0 to 15 in binary

Uses 4 digital output pins to control LEDs

Adjustable delay between counts

Ideal for beginners to learn about binary numbers, digital output, and embedded systems

ğŸ§° Hardware Used
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

4x LEDs

4x 220Î© resistors

Breadboard and jumper wires

ğŸ§  Concepts Covered
Digital output control

Binary number representation

Looping and bitwise operations in Arduino
